test repository week 1

Hello everyone! 
Happy Wednesday, and may the odds be ever in your favor. 

This is another test edit, this time creating a branch on the fly. 

Making edits inside my computer RStudio window. Will committ to GitHub online. 

Now I'm on a seperate branch. I'll have to commit and then push my edits, 
otherwise the master branch is unchanged. 

Now I'm editing on GitHub, and then I'll push it to RStudio.
