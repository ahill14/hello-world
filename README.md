# hello-world
test repository week 1

Hello everyone! 
Happy Wednesday, and may the odds be ever in your favor. 

This is another test edit, this time creating a branch on the fly. 

Making edits inside my computer RStudio window. Will committ to GitHub online. 

Now I'm on a seperate branch. I'll have to commit and then push my edits, 
otherwise the master branch is unchanged. 

Now I'm editing on GitHub, and then I'll push it to RStudio 
(with a push request). 
Jk it's not a request when you push you just push it and it goes. 




(from repo_from_github)
Testing to make sure I know how to get a repo from github to R. 

Just a couple lines of edits in R. 
Gonna commit, and then push. What a bro. 

Verified in github. You don't have to accept a push if it's straight onto the master. 
Now a pull back to R. 

If it's on the same branch, you just push and pull with no requests. 

Now I'm editing in a new branch on github. 
Got the newbranch in R, gonna edit real quick.
